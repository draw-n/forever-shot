# Forever Shot
## Description
Initially created for the Low-Effort Game Jam, but was eventually improved on after the jam ended. Was an inital attempt at building a game almost entirely from custom assets. <br>
The game focuses on a ship, which is able to move in the four cardinal directions. However, its up and down movement is heavily restricted by the available tokens it has. To gain these tokens and protect the home base, the ship must destroy the incoming enemy ships.
